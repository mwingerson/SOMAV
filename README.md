This README is a very rough version and a horrible work in progress.

How to get the included python scripts to run

This series of scripts are built in Windows Powershell and is tested working in windows 7 and windows 10

install MavProxy from here: http://firmware.us.ardupilot.org/Tools/MAVProxy/MAVProxySetup-latest.exe

install Python 2.7 

After Python is installed, 

add the python install directory, Python scripts directory and Mavproxy install directory to system environment variable NOT user environment variables.

Install additional python packages:
pip install Enum
pip install dronekit
pip install dronekit-sitl

The latest and greatest script is "import2.py"

Use "kill_all.py" to kill background threads
